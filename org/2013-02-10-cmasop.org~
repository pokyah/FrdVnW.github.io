Social–Ecological Systems (SES) are complex due to uncertainty related to their nature and their functions. In these systems, decision-making processes and practices of managers are often value-laden and subjective, dominated by their world-views and their own knowledge. People’s knowledge are central in building their adaptive capacity but are seldom taken into account by traditional decision-making approaches in modelling SES management. In this paper, we introduce a Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping approach to study the dynamic behaviour of managers’ systems of practices. As a case study, we aim to assess farmers’ forage management under different climatic scenarios. Results show that summer drought have varying consequences according to farmers’ systems of practices. Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping approaches are particularly relevant in studying systems of practices in SES. Their utilisation is promising for the evaluation of adaptive capacity and resilience in SES at local scale (exploitation, community) and regional scale (ecological areas, country).

Development of a broadened cognitive mapping approach for analysing systems of practices in social-ecological systems
by fredvanwin

This paper presents a new cognitive mapping approach for analysing systems of practices in socialâ€“ecological systems. These systems are mapped from people’s views collected during open-ended interviews. Cognitive maps are made up of diverse variables (e.g., operations, drivers, constraints) linked to each other by a range of relationships: causeâ€“effect, fluxes of matter, information flows and sequence of two operations. Individual cognitive maps heuristically model the practices and decision-making processes expressed by interviewees. The mathematical formulation of cognitive maps allows individual cognitive maps to be aggregated into a social cognitive map. The latter can be used to model the system of practices used by a particular group of people. Using this approach, we analysed the practices and decision-making processes linked to grassland management in a Belgian grassland-based livestock farming system. Our work confirmed that a social cognitive map could be drawn up for multiple locations. The results showed how this inductive cognitive mapping approach overcame two limitations frequently highlighted in previous studies: the diverse interpretations of variables and relationships; and the difficulty in revealing the rationale in cognitive maps.
